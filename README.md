• When landlord accepts the request the address gets
displayed on tenant’s web application and the address
is also stored in Aadhaar website for further
verification.
• If landlord rejects the request the process is
terminated and tenant cannot update their address
Tenant is given access to make minor changes like
adding landmarks etc. but they are not permitted to
make major changes.
• Aadhaar website tracks the address of the landlord that
was stored and the tenant’s modified address using GPS
tracking.
• If both the addresses are similar only then the address
update process will continue otherwise the process is
terminated .
