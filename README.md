Landlord is provided with two options one is accepting
the request and permitting the tenant to modify the
address and the other is rejecting the request.
• When landlord accepts the request the address gets
displayed on tenant’s web application and the address
is also stored in Aadhaar website for further
verification.
• If landlord rejects the request the process is
terminated and tenant cannot update their address
